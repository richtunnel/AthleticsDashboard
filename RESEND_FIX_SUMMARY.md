# Resend API Key Build Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
The build was failing with the error:
```
Error: Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor `new Resend("re_123")`
```

This occurred because Resend clients were being initialized at module level (during build time) when environment variables may not be available.

## Solution
Implemented **lazy initialization pattern** for all Resend client instantiations.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created Centralized Resend Helper (`/src/lib/resend.ts`)
Created a new helper module with three functions:
- `getResendClient()` - Returns Resend client or throws error if not configured
- `getResendClientOptional()` - Returns Resend client or null if not configured
- `getResendClientCached()` - Returns cached singleton Resend client

**Key Benefit:** All `new Resend()` calls are now inside functions, not at module level, so they execute at request time, not build time.

#### 2. Updated All Files Using Resend

##### Fixed Files:
1. **`/src/app/api/recovery-email/send/route.ts`** (Primary issue from ticket)
   - Removed: `const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);`
   - Changed to: `const resend = getResendClient();` inside POST handler

2. **`/src/lib/services/email.service.ts`**
   - Removed module-level: `const resend = process.env.RESEND_API_KEY ? new Resend(...) : null;`
   - Changed to: `const resend = getResendClientOptional();` inside methods

3. **`/src/app/api/email/send/route.ts`**
   - Removed module-level initialization
   - Changed to lazy initialization in POST handler

4. **`/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/actions.ts`**
   - Removed module-level initialization
   - Changed to lazy initialization in resetPassword function

5. **`/src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/actions.ts`**
   - Removed module-level initialization
   - Changed to lazy initialization in requestPasswordReset function

6. **`/src/app/api/cron/account-cleanup/route.ts`**
   - Removed module-level initialization
   - Changed to lazy initialization in POST handler

#### 3. Fixed Unrelated Build Error
Also fixed a Suspense boundary warning in `/src/app/verify-recovery-email/page.tsx` that was preventing build completion.

## Verification
✅ Build completes successfully: `npm run build`
✅ No Resend API key errors during build
✅ All email routes use lazy initialization pattern
✅ No module-level Resend instantiation anywhere in codebase

## Pattern Used
**Before (❌ Bad - Runs at build time):**
```typescript
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY); // Module level

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  await resend.emails.send(...);
}
```

**After (✅ Good - Runs at request time):**
```typescript
import { getResendClient } from '@/lib/resend';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const resend = getResendClient(); // Initialize when needed
  await resend.emails.send(...);
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Build Success:** No build-time errors even without RESEND_API_KEY
2. **Clear Errors:** Runtime errors clearly indicate missing configuration
3. **Centralized:** Single source of truth for Resend client creation
4. **Flexible:** Optional client for graceful degradation in development
5. **Reusable:** Helper functions can be used throughout the codebase
