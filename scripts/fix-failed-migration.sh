# 
# Background:
# The migration failed because it's an "init" migration trying to create tables
# that already exist in the database (from previous migrations in migrations_old/).
#
# Solution:
# We'll mark this migration as "applied" since the database schema already matches
# what the migration would create. This is the standard approach when consolidating
# migration history.
