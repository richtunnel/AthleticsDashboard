## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### PostgreSQL Installation

#### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

#### Windows
Download and install from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

### Create the Database

```bash
# Access PostgreSQL
psql postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE athletics_dashboard;

# Create user (optional)
CREATE USER your_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE athletics_dashboard TO your_user;

# Exit
\q
```

### Run Migrations

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
yarn prisma migrate dev

# Or deploy migrations in production
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

### Seed Data

The seed script populates your database with:
- Sample organization (Central High School)
- Default user (dev@example.com)
- Sports (Football, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball, Baseball, Softball)
- Teams at various levels
- Opponents with mascots and colors
- Venues with addresses
- Sample games

```bash
yarn prisma db seed
```

### Prisma Studio

View and edit your database with Prisma's GUI:

```bash
yarn prisma studio
```

Open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

## üõ°Ô∏è Prisma Migration Troubleshooting

When Prisma reports an error such as `P3009` referencing the `20251024000526_new_migration`, the target database still records that migration as failed in the `_prisma_migrations` table. Follow the checklist below to bring the database back to a consistent state and keep future deployments safe.

### Quick commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check migration status | `yarn migrate:status` |
| Mark `20251024000526_new_migration` as rolled back | `yarn migrate:resolve:rollback 20251024000526_new_migration` |
| Mark a migration as applied (only if schema already matches) | `yarn migrate:resolve:applied <migration_id>` |
| Deploy pending migrations | `yarn migrate:deploy` |
| Pre-deployment health check | `yarn migrate:check` |
| Reset local database (destructive) | `yarn prisma migrate reset` |

These commands wrap the helper scripts in `scripts/prisma-migration-troubleshoot.sh` and `scripts/prisma-predeploy-check.sh` for convenience.

### 1. Check the database state

1. Export the database connection string (example for DigitalOcean ‚Äì replace placeholders with your credentials):
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@app-2dd01d8a-31e6-4723-b689-814bd76312a9-do-user-11349805-0.h.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/adscheduler?schema=public&sslmode=require"
   ```
2. Run the status command to see whether any migrations are pending, failed, or drifted:
   ```bash
   yarn migrate:status
   ```
   This wraps `npx prisma migrate status` and requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set.

### 2. Resolve the failed migration safely

- If the migration failed part-way through (most common), mark it as **rolled back** so Prisma can attempt it again:
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:resolve:rollback 20251024000526_new_migration
  # Equivalent: npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251024000526_new_migration
  ```
- If you manually verified that the changes already exist in the database, mark it as **applied** instead:
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:resolve:applied 20251024000526_new_migration
  # Equivalent: npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251024000526_new_migration
  ```
- Re-run the migrations to apply the updated SQL (we added automatic data backfills and de-duplication for `EmailGroup` in this migration so it can succeed when retried):
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:deploy
  ```

### 3. Understand why the migration failed

1. Inspect the migration logs stored by Prisma:
   ```sql
   SELECT migration_name, finished_at, rolled_back_at, logs
   FROM "_prisma_migrations"
   WHERE migration_name = '20251024000526_new_migration';
   ```
2. Review the SQL at `prisma/migrations/20251024000526_new_migration/migration.sql`. The file now:
   - Backfills `EmailGroup.organizationId` from the owning user.
   - Renames duplicate group names per organization before enforcing the unique constraint.
   - Blocks the change if any `organizationId` would still be `NULL`.
3. If additional data cleanup is required, perform it manually and re-run the migration deploy command.

### 4. Add guard rails to deployments

- Run the pre-check script before starting any production instance (useful for CI/CD or container health checks):
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:check
  ```
  `scripts/prisma-predeploy-check.sh` exits non-zero when pending migrations or drift are detected so your pipeline can fail fast.
- Keep migration execution separate from starting the application (e.g., run `yarn migrate:deploy` or `yarn migrate:check` in a dedicated job before launching `yarn start`).

### 5. Development-only reset option

For local environments you can drop and recreate the database from scratch:
```bash
yarn prisma migrate reset
```
Do **not** use this in production because all data will be lost. Instead, resolve or roll back the problematic migration as shown above.

### 6. Include a runtime health check

If you run the app in Docker or on a PaaS, add a health/ready check that executes `yarn migrate:check`. This ensures the server only starts when the schema in the database matches the Prisma schema, preventing future startup failures caused by schema drift.

## üèÉ Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Build

Build the optimized production bundle:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Production Server

Run the production server:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Production with Database Migration

**Note:** Automatic migrations during deployment have been disabled to prevent deployment failures. The `start:prod` script now only starts the server without running migrations.

To run database migrations manually when needed:

```bash
# Deploy pending migrations to production database
yarn migrate:deploy

# Or use the full command
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Then start the production server:

```bash
yarn start:prod
```

> **Important:** Database migrations must be run manually before deploying new code that requires schema changes. This separation allows you to:
> - Control when migrations run
> - Handle migration failures without blocking deployments
> - Test migrations independently
> - Roll back or resolve problematic migrations before redeploying

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
yarn type-check
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy Next.js applications:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on every push

```bash
# Or use Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Railway

Deploy with PostgreSQL included:

1. Create account on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
2. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
3. Add PostgreSQL plugin
4. Configure environment variables
5. Railway will auto-deploy

### DigitalOcean App Platform

DigitalOcean's App Platform can deploy this project directly from the repository or from a container image. When using the Node.js runtime, configure the app with:

1. **Build command:** `yarn prisma generate && yarn build`
2. **Run command:** `yarn prisma migrate deploy && yarn start`
3. **Environment:** set `NODE_VERSION` (or `NODEJS_VERSION`) to `20` to match the engine requirements.
4. **Secrets:** mark `DATABASE_URL` and any variables required during build time as `RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME`. All other secrets (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, OAuth keys) can remain `RUN_TIME`.
5. **Database:** if you use a managed Postgres instance, append `?sslmode=require` to the `DATABASE_URL` so Prisma can connect over TLS.
6. **Application URL:** set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the live app domain (e.g., `https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app` or your custom domain).
7. **Secrets & APIs:** provide `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

After deployment completes, trigger `yarn prisma migrate deploy` (via the start command above) to ensure the database schema is up to date. You can also use the provided `.do/app.yaml` template with `doctl apps update` if you prefer managing the spec through code.

> üí° **Tip:** Add a dedicated pipeline step (or App Platform pre-deployment job) that runs `yarn migrate:check`. The command exits non-zero when pending migrations or drift are detected so deployments can fail fast before the application starts.

### Docker

This application is fully optimized for Docker deployment with a multi-stage build that minimizes image size and memory usage. Perfect for platforms like App Platform, Cloud Run, ECS, and others.

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Build image
yarn docker:build

# Run container
yarn docker:run:detached

# View logs
yarn docker:logs

# Stop container
yarn docker:stop
```

**With Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL + Adminer):**

```bash
# Start all services
yarn docker:compose:up

# View logs
yarn docker:compose:logs

# Stop all services
yarn docker:compose:down
```

**Direct Docker commands:**

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t athletics-dashboard:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env athletics-dashboard:latest

# With Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

**üì¶ Optimizations:**
- Multi-stage build with 3 stages (deps, builder, runner)
- Next.js standalone output mode for minimal bundle
- Alpine Linux base (~300-400MB final image)
- Memory limit: 4GB during build
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks included

### Database Migrations in Production

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Automatic migrations during deployment are disabled by default.**

Database migrations are no longer run automatically during application startup. This prevents deployment failures due to migration errors (e.g., P3009) and gives you better control over when schema changes are applied.

**To run migrations manually:**

```bash
# Before deploying new code with schema changes
yarn migrate:deploy

# Or use npx directly
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Deployment workflow:**

1. Deploy your application (migrations will NOT run automatically)
2. The app will connect to the database using the existing schema
3. When you need to apply schema changes, run migrations manually as a separate step
4. Use `yarn migrate:check` to verify migration status before deployment

**Why migrations are separate:**
- ‚úÖ App can deploy successfully even if there are pending migrations
- ‚úÖ Migrations can be fixed and tested without re-deploying the entire app
- ‚úÖ Failed migrations don't block application startup
- ‚úÖ Better control over when schema changes are applied in production
- ‚úÖ Easier to roll back or resolve migration issues

See the [Prisma Migration Troubleshooting](#-prisma-migration-troubleshooting) section for details on resolving migration issues.

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure these are set in your hosting platform:
- `DATABASE_URL` (production database)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (secure random string)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (your production URL)
- All API keys and secrets
