## 🗄️ Database Setup

### PostgreSQL Installation

#### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

#### Windows
Download and install from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

### Create the Database

psql postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE athletics_dashboard;

# Create user (optional)
CREATE USER your_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE athletics_dashboard TO your_user;

# Exit
\q
```

### Run Migrations

```bash
# Run all pending migrations
yarn prisma migrate dev

# Or deploy migrations in production
yarn prisma migrate deploy
```

### Seed Data

The seed script populates your database with:
- Sample organization (Central High School)
- Default user (dev@example.com)
- Sports (Football, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball, Baseball, Softball)
- Teams at various levels
- Opponents with mascots and colors
- Venues with addresses
- Sample games

```bash
yarn prisma db seed
```

### Prisma Studio

View and edit your database with Prisma's GUI:

```bash
yarn prisma studio
```

Open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)

## 🛡️ Prisma Migration Troubleshooting

When Prisma reports an error such as `P3009` referencing the `20251024000526_new_migration`, the target database still records that migration as failed in the `_prisma_migrations` table. Follow the checklist below to bring the database back to a consistent state and keep future deployments safe.

### Quick commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check migration status | `yarn migrate:status` |
| Mark `20251024000526_new_migration` as rolled back | `yarn migrate:resolve:rollback 20251024000526_new_migration` |
| Mark a migration as applied (only if schema already matches) | `yarn migrate:resolve:applied <migration_id>` |
| Deploy pending migrations | `yarn migrate:deploy` |
| Pre-deployment health check | `yarn migrate:check` |
| Reset local database (destructive) | `yarn prisma migrate reset` |

These commands wrap the helper scripts in `scripts/prisma-migration-troubleshoot.sh` and `scripts/prisma-predeploy-check.sh` for convenience.

### 1. Check the database state

1. Export the database connection string (example for DigitalOcean – replace placeholders with your credentials):
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@app-2dd01d8a-31e6-4723-b689-814bd76312a9-do-user-11349805-0.h.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/adscheduler?schema=public&sslmode=require"
   ```
2. Run the status command to see whether any migrations are pending, failed, or drifted:
   ```bash
   yarn migrate:status
   ```
   This wraps `npx prisma migrate status` and requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set.

### 2. Resolve the failed migration safely

- If the migration failed part-way through (most common), mark it as **rolled back** so Prisma can attempt it again:
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:resolve:rollback 20251024000526_new_migration
  # Equivalent: npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251024000526_new_migration
  ```
- If you manually verified that the changes already exist in the database, mark it as **applied** instead:
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:resolve:applied 20251024000526_new_migration
  # Equivalent: npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251024000526_new_migration
  ```
- Re-run the migrations to apply the updated SQL (we added automatic data backfills and de-duplication for `EmailGroup` in this migration so it can succeed when retried):
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:deploy
  ```

### 3. Understand why the migration failed

1. Inspect the migration logs stored by Prisma:
   ```sql
   SELECT migration_name, finished_at, rolled_back_at, logs
   FROM "_prisma_migrations"
   WHERE migration_name = '20251024000526_new_migration';
   ```
2. Review the SQL at `prisma/migrations/20251024000526_new_migration/migration.sql`. The file now:
   - Backfills `EmailGroup.organizationId` from the owning user.
   - Renames duplicate group names per organization before enforcing the unique constraint.
   - Blocks the change if any `organizationId` would still be `NULL`.
3. If additional data cleanup is required, perform it manually and re-run the migration deploy command.

### 4. Add guard rails to deployments

- Run the pre-check script before starting any production instance (useful for CI/CD or container health checks):
  ```bash
  yarn migrate:check
  ```
  `scripts/prisma-predeploy-check.sh` exits non-zero when pending migrations or drift are detected so your pipeline can fail fast.
- Keep migration execution separate from starting the application (e.g., run `yarn migrate:deploy` or `yarn migrate:check` in a dedicated job before launching `yarn start`).

### 5. Development-only reset option

For local environments you can drop and recreate the database from scratch:
```bash
yarn prisma migrate reset
```
Do **not** use this in production because all data will be lost. Instead, resolve or roll back the problematic migration as shown above.

### 6. Include a runtime health check

If you run the app in Docker or on a PaaS, add a health/ready check that executes `yarn migrate:check`. This ensures the server only starts when the schema in the database matches the Prisma schema, preventing future startup failures caused by schema drift.

## 🏃 Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Build

Build the optimized production bundle:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Production Server

Run the production server:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Production with Database Migration

This command runs migrations before starting the server (useful for deployment):

```bash
yarn start:prod
```

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
yarn type-check
```

### Maintenance & Automation
- `POST /api/cron/account-cleanup` - Secure cron entry point that sends deletion reminders and removes accounts once the grace period has expired. Requires the `x-cron-secret` header to match `CRON_SECRET`.

## 🧹 Automated Account Cleanup

The cleanup endpoint enforces the 14-day grace period after cancellation, sends reminder emails, and deletes expired accounts. Configure your hosting provider's scheduler to call it with a shared secret.

### Trigger Details
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Endpoint:** `https://<your-domain>/api/cron/account-cleanup`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `x-cron-secret: ${CRON_SECRET}` (required)
- **Body:** Empty object (`{}`) or omitted
- **Recommended cadence:** Once per day (e.g., `0 6 * * *`) so 7-day and 1-day reminders are delivered predictably.

### Example (Vercel Cron)
```json
{
  "path": "/api/cron/account-cleanup",
  "schedule": "0 6 * * *",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "x-cron-secret": "${CRON_SECRET}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

### Example (Railway)
1. Open **Deployments → Cron Jobs → New Cron Job**
2. Set the schedule to `0 6 * * *` (adjust for your timezone)
3. Choose **POST** and the path `/api/cron/account-cleanup`
4. Add header `x-cron-secret` with the value of `CRON_SECRET`
5. Save — Railway will now invoke the job daily

### Customisation
- Adjust `ACCOUNT_DELETION_GRACE_DAYS` if you need a longer or shorter grace period
- Tweak `ACCOUNT_DELETION_REMINDER_DAYS` (comma separated) to send additional reminders
- The response payload logs counts of reminders sent, deletions, Stripe cancellations, and any errors for auditing

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Create account on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Add PostgreSQL plugin
4. Configure environment variables
5. Railway will auto-deploy

### DigitalOcean App Platform

DigitalOcean's App Platform can deploy this project directly from the repository or from a container image. When using the Node.js runtime, configure the app with:

1. **Build command:** `yarn prisma generate && yarn build`
2. **Run command:** `yarn prisma migrate deploy && yarn start`
3. **Environment:** set `NODE_VERSION` (or `NODEJS_VERSION`) to `20` to match the engine requirements.
4. **Secrets:** mark `DATABASE_URL` and any variables required during build time as `RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME`. All other secrets (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, OAuth keys) can remain `RUN_TIME`.
5. **Database:** if you use a managed Postgres instance, append `?sslmode=require` to the `DATABASE_URL` so Prisma can connect over TLS.
6. **Application URL:** set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the live app domain (e.g., `https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app` or your custom domain).
7. **Secrets & APIs:** provide `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

After deployment completes, trigger `yarn prisma migrate deploy` (via the start command above) to ensure the database schema is up to date. You can also use the provided `.do/app.yaml` template with `doctl apps update` if you prefer managing the spec through code.

> 💡 **Tip:** Add a dedicated pipeline step (or App Platform pre-deployment job) that runs `yarn migrate:check`. The command exits non-zero when pending migrations or drift are detected so deployments can fail fast before the application starts.

### Docker

This application is fully optimized for Docker deployment with a multi-stage build that minimizes image size and memory usage. Perfect for platforms like App Platform, Cloud Run, ECS, and others.

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Build image
yarn docker:build

# Run container
yarn docker:run:detached

# View logs
yarn docker:logs

# Stop container
yarn docker:stop
```

**With Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL + Adminer):**

```bash
# Start all services
yarn docker:compose:up

# View logs
yarn docker:compose:logs

# Stop all services
yarn docker:compose:down
```

**Direct Docker commands:**

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t athletics-dashboard:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env athletics-dashboard:latest

# With Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

**📦 Optimizations:**
- Multi-stage build with 3 stages (deps, builder, runner)
- Next.js standalone output mode for minimal bundle
- Alpine Linux base (~300-400MB final image)
- Memory limit: 4GB during build
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks included

**📖 For detailed Docker deployment instructions**, including platform-specific guides for Google Cloud Run, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS, and more, see **[DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md)**.

### Environment Variables for Production

Ensure these are set in your hosting platform:
- `DATABASE_URL` (production database)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (secure random string)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (your production URL)
- All API keys and secrets
