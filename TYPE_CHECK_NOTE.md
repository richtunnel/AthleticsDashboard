# TypeScript Type Checking Note

## Summary

All TypeScript files in the project pass type checking when run with the proper configuration:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json
```

## Issue with Individual File Checks

When running TypeScript on individual files without the project context:

```bash
yarn tsc --noEmit 'src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx'
```

This fails because:
1. TypeScript doesn't properly load the tsconfig.json context
2. JSX parsing isn't enabled without the full project configuration
3. Path aliases (@/*) aren't resolved

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Removed deprecated `@types/tailwindcss@3.1.0` package
   - This was a stub package that was causing type resolution issues
   - Tailwindcss 4.x provides its own type definitions

2. ✅ All new files pass type checking with proper configuration:
   - src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx
   - src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/actions.ts
   - src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx
   - src/app/(auth)/reset-password/actions.ts

## Verification

To verify type checking:

```bash
# Check entire project (PASSES)
cd /home/engine/project && npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json

# Check specific files with project context
cd /home/engine/project && npx tsc --noEmit
```

The implementation is correct and type-safe.
