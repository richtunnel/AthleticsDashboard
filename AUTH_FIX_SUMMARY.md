# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were unable to sign in or create accounts in production. The sign-in button would get stuck in a loading state, and the URL would show `?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard%2Fgames`, creating an infinite redirect loop.

## Root Cause
The "Sign In" button on the home page (/) was attempting to navigate directly to `/dashboard/games` without authenticating the user first. This caused the following flow:

1. User clicks "Sign In" button on home page
2. Button attempts to navigate to `/dashboard/games`
3. NextAuth middleware intercepts the request (user is not authenticated)
4. Middleware redirects user back to `/` (sign-in page) with `?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard%2Fgames`
5. User is back on home page with button stuck in loading state
6. Infinite loop - no actual authentication happens

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Home Page Sign-In Button Navigation
**File:** `src/components/home/HomePageContent.tsx`

Changed the navigation path from `/dashboard/games` to `/login`:

```typescript
// Before
navigationPath: "/dashboard/games",

// After  
navigationPath: "/login",
```

This ensures users are taken to the actual login page where they can:
- Sign in with Google OAuth
- Sign in with email/password credentials
- Create a new account

### 2. Improved Loading State Management
**File:** `src/lib/hooks/useAuthButton.ts`

Added a timeout to reset the loading state after navigation to prevent stuck loading states:

```typescript
case "navigation":
  if (!navigationPath) {
    throw new Error("Navigation path required");
  }
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 150));
  router.push(navigationPath);
  // Reset loading after a short delay to handle cases where navigation doesn't unmount
  setTimeout(() => setLoading(false), 1000);
  break;
```

### 3. Fixed Undefined Function Call Bug
**File:** `src/app/onboarding/signup/page.tsx`

Removed calls to non-existent `setLoading(false)` function that would cause runtime errors.

## Authentication Flow (After Fix)

### Sign In Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign In" on home page (/)
2. User is navigated to `/login` page
3. User can choose to:
   - Sign in with Google OAuth
   - Sign in with email/password
4. After successful authentication, NextAuth redirects to `/dashboard` (or callback URL if specified)

### Sign Up Flow:
1. User clicks "Get Started" on home page
2. User is navigated to `/onboarding/plans` to choose a plan
3. User selects a plan and is taken to signup page
4. User creates account via Google OAuth or email/password
5. After successful signup, user is redirected to onboarding or dashboard

## Files Modified
- `src/components/home/HomePageContent.tsx` - Fixed sign-in navigation path
- `src/lib/hooks/useAuthButton.ts` - Improved loading state management
- `src/app/onboarding/signup/page.tsx` - Removed undefined function calls

## Testing Checklist
✅ Sign in button navigates to login page
✅ Login page allows Google OAuth sign-in
✅ Login page allows credential sign-in
✅ Signup flow works end-to-end
✅ No stuck loading states
✅ Authentication redirects work correctly
✅ Middleware protection works as expected

## Production Environment Checklist
Ensure the following environment variables are set in Digital Ocean:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Should be `https://adhub-8ajac.ondigitalocean.app`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Must be set to a secure random string
- `DATABASE_URL` - Must point to production database
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` - For Google OAuth
- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` - For Google OAuth

Also verify in Google Cloud Console:
- Authorized JavaScript origins: `https://adhub-8ajac.ondigitalocean.app`
- Authorized redirect URIs: `https://adhub-8ajac.ondigitalocean.app/api/auth/callback/google`
