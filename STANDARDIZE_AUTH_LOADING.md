# Standardize Auth Loading Implementation

## Summary

This implementation standardizes all auth-related loading states across the application by creating shared utilities that manage loading, disable, and spinner states consistently across all authentication entry points.

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/lib/hooks/useAuthButton.ts`
A custom React hook that manages authentication actions with loading states. Supports:
- **OAuth providers**: Google, Azure AD
- **Credential auth**: Email/password sign-in
- **Navigation**: Client-side routing with loading state
- **Custom actions**: Any async auth-related operation

Features:
- Automatic loading state management
- Error handling with callbacks
- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Consistent callback URL handling

### 2. `/src/components/auth/AuthActionButton.tsx`
A reusable Material UI button component specifically designed for auth actions:
- Shows CircularProgress spinner when loading
- Automatically disables when loading or explicitly disabled
- Supports all MUI Button variants (contained, outlined, text)
- Optional loading text override
- Keyboard accessible and maintains disabled state

### 3. `/src/components/home/HomePageContent.tsx`
Client component for the homepage that uses the new auth utilities:
- "Sign in" button with navigation loading state
- "Get Started" button with navigation loading state
- Both buttons disable each other while one is loading

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Converted from server to client component
- Now imports and renders `HomePageContent`

### 2. `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- Integrated `useAuthButton` hook for Google and credentials auth
- Replaced manual loading state management
- All auth buttons now use `AuthActionButton` component
- Loading states properly coordinated (both buttons disable when either is loading)
- Form inputs disable during any auth action

### 3. `/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`
- Integrated `useAuthButton` hook for Google and credentials auth
- Handles complex signup flow: API call → auto-login → redirect
- All auth buttons use `AuthActionButton` component
- Coordinated loading states across all actions

### 4. `/src/app/onboarding/signup/page.tsx`
- Integrated `useAuthButton` hook for Google, Azure AD, and credentials auth
- Added loading state to Microsoft button (previously missing)
- All three OAuth/credential methods now have consistent loading behavior
- Form disables during any auth action

### 5. `/src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- Integrated `AuthActionButton` for "Send Reset Link" button
- Consistent loading spinner and disabled state

### 6. `/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`
- Integrated `AuthActionButton` for "Reset Password" button
- Consistent loading spinner and disabled state

### 7. `/src/app/onboarding/plans/page.tsx`
- Integrated `AuthActionButton` for "Get started" buttons
- Shows "Processing..." text while loading
- Prevents duplicate plan selections

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Loading State Management
- All auth buttons show a CircularProgress spinner when loading
- Button text is replaced by spinner or loading text
- No duplicate submissions possible

### 2. Consistent Disabled Behavior
- Buttons disable themselves when loading
- Buttons disable each other on the same page when one is loading
- Form inputs disable during auth actions
- Maintains keyboard accessibility

### 3. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling through `onError` callbacks
- Errors properly reset loading state
- User-friendly error messages displayed

### 4. Visual Consistency
- All spinners use Material UI's CircularProgress at size 20
- Spinner color matches button variant (inherit color)
- Consistent spacing and positioning

### 5. OAuth vs Credentials Flow
- OAuth actions maintain loading state during redirect
- Credential actions properly handle async operations and navigation
- Custom actions support complex multi-step flows (signup → login → redirect)

## Auth Entry Points Covered

1. ✅ **Homepage** - Sign in & Get Started buttons
2. ✅ **Login page** - Google OAuth & Email/Password sign-in
3. ✅ **Signup page** - Google OAuth & Email/Password sign-up
4. ✅ **Onboarding Signup** - Google, Microsoft, & manual sign-up
5. ✅ **Forgot Password** - Send reset link button
6. ✅ **Reset Password** - Reset password button
7. ✅ **Onboarding Plans** - Get started buttons for plan selection

## Regression Prevention

- ✅ Keyboard accessibility preserved (buttons remain focusable, proper tab order)
- ✅ Form validation still works (checked before loading state)
- ✅ Error states properly displayed
- ✅ Success flows unchanged
- ✅ Material UI theming and styling respected
- ✅ Loading state clears on error or completion

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Clicking any auth CTA immediately disables it
- ✅ Renders a loading indicator (CircularProgress spinner)
- ✅ Does not allow duplicate submissions
- ✅ Resumes normal state on completion or error
- ✅ Works across all auth entry points
- ✅ Visual consistency with Material UI design system
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility preserved
